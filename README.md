## Challenges ü§î
I have never used PHP before, so for this particular task I had to learn enough to understand the basic construct of the language first and foremost, noticing similarities in syntax patterns from Javascript.

There were also necessary initial installation steps (as mentioned above) in order to use PHP that I learned (mostly by error) as I went along.

An issue I faced was the application was not updating with the results each and every time you input a new word. Upon looking into this issue further, I realised that I didn't include the POST method in the form to send data to the server, as well as including the action attribute to process the data on the same page that the form is on (the same PHP file).

There is a bug I'm currently trying to fix - when you enter a word into the Palindrome Checker, it shows the result in the Pangram Checker when it shouldn't.
